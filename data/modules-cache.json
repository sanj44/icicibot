botpress-slack\n\nOfficial Slack connector module for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress).\n\nThis module has been built to accelerate and facilitate development of Slack bots.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstalling modules on Botpress is simple. By using CLI, users only need to type this command in their terminal to add slack module to their bot.\n\n```js\nbotpress install slack\n```\n\nIt's also possible to install it through the Botpress UI in the modules section.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo setup connexion of your chatbot to Slack, you need to fill the connexion settings directly in the module interface. In fact, you only need to follow these steps and your bot will be ready to use.\n\nSettings can also be set programmatically by providing the settings in the `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-slack.json`\n\n<img alt='Connexion settings' src='assets/connexion-settings.png' width='700px'/>\n\n#### 1. Setup Hostname\n\nYou need to manually enter your hostname. If you are developping locally, we suggest using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to deploy your chatbot ([learn more about ngrok](https://ngrok.com)\n\n#### 2. Create a [**Slack app**](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)\n  \n<img alt='Create app' src='/assets/create-app-slack.png' width='450px' />\n\n#### 3. Get Client ID and Client Secret\n\nThese information are available on **Basic Information** of you app. You only need to copy them in module interface.\n\n<img alt='Client id and client secret' src='/assets/client-id-client-secret.png' width='500px' />\n\n#### 4. Setup OAuth & Permissions\n\nOn the **OAuth & Permissions** page of your slack app, you need to enter your redirect url for the authentification. The redirect url need to be `${hostname}/modules/botpress-slack` as you can see in the example screenshot below.\n\n<img alt='OAuth settings' src='/assets/oauth.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 5. Create a Bot User\n\nOn the **Bot Users** page of your slack app, you need to add a Bot User by clicking on **Add a Bot User**. We suggest you to turn on **Always Show My Bot as Online** for be able to use RTM API correctly.\n\n<img alt='Bot users' src='/assets/bot-user.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 6. Setup Interactive Messages\n\nOn the **Interactive messages** page of your slack app, you need to **Enable Interactive Messages** and add a **Request URL**. The URL entered needs to be format as `${hostname}/api/botpress-slack/action-endpoint`.\n\n<img alt='Interactive messages' src='/assets/interactive-messages.png' width='500px;' />\n\n#### 7. Get Verification Token\n\nThe verification token should appear below App Id and App  information are available on **Basic Information** of you app. You only need to copy them in module interface.\n\n<img alt='App id and app secret' src='/assets/verification-token.png' width='500px' />\n\n#### 8. Set scope\n\nOn your configuration page of your module, you need to set scope of your bot. We suggest you to keep the default configuration (**admin,bot,chat:write:bot,commands,identify,incoming-webhook**), but if you want to want to modify it, we suggest you to look to the [documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes).\n\n#### 9. Authenticate & Connect\n\nNext step is to authenticate and connect your bot. To do it, you only need to click on **Authenticate & Connect** on your module and follow the steps. Once it will be done, you should received an **API Token** and a **Bot Token**. They will appear on your settings page of your module.\n\n<img alt='Connexion completed' src='/assets/completed.png' width='500px;' />\n\nIf you want to have more information about documentation, options and API, we suggest you to look at the [official slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/).\n\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Profile](#profile)\n* [Text](#text)\n* [Reaction](#reaction)\n* [Typing](#typing)\n* [File](#file)\n* [User mention](#user-mention)\n* [Bot mention](#bot-mention)\n* [Others](#others)\n* [Direct message](#direct-message)\n* [Validation](#validation)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text](#text)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Reaction](#reaction)\n* [Update text](#update-text)\n* [Update attachments](#update-attachments)\n* [Delete text or attachments](#delete-text-or-attachments)\n* [Remove reaction](#remove-reaction)\n\n### API\n\n* Status\n* User\n* Users\n* Channels\n* Team\n* Data\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming event easily with Botpress by using `bp` built-in `hear` function. You only need to listen to specific Slack event to be able to react to user's actions.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'slack', type: 'message', text: 'Hello' }, (event, next) => {\n\tbp.slack.sendText(event.channel.id, 'Welcome on Botpress!!!')\n})\n```\n\nIn fact, this module preprocesses almost all types of message (message, reaction, attachments, file, typing...) and send them to incoming middlewares. When you build a bot or a module, you can access to all information about incoming messages that have been send to  middlewares.\n\n```js\nbp.middlewares.sendIncoming({\n\tplatform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'message',\n\ttext: 'Text message here... (e.g. Hello world)'\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n})\n```\n\n#### Profile\n\nYou can acces to all user's profile information (`event.user`) by using this module. A cache have been implemented to fetch all information about users and this information is sent to middlewares.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"id\": \"U023BECGF\",\n  \"team_id\": \"T021F9ZE2\",\n  \"name\": \"bobby\",\n  \"deleted\": false,\n  \"status\": null,\n  \"color\": \"9f69e7\",\n  \"real_name\": \"Bobby Tables\",\n  \"tz\": \"America\\/Los_Angeles\",\n  \"tz_label\": \"Pacific Daylight Time\",\n  \"tz_offset\": -25200,\n  \"profile\": {\n      \"avatar_hash\": \"ge3b51ca72de\",\n      \"first_name\": \"Bobby\",\n      \"last_name\": \"Tables\",\n      \"real_name\": \"Bobby Tables\",\n      \"email\": \"bobby@slack.com\",\n      \"skype\": \"my-skype-name\",\n      \"phone\": \"+1 (123) 456 7890\",\n      \"image_24\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_32\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_48\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_72\": \"https:\\/\\/...\",\n      \"image_192\": \"https:\\/\\/...\"\n  },\n  \"is_admin\": true,\n  \"is_owner\": true,\n  \"has_2fa\": false\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: All new users are automatically saved by this module in Botpress built-in database (`bp.db`).\n\n#### Text\n\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Slack platform with all specific information.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'message',\n\ttext: 'Text message here... (e.g. Hello world)',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can listen easily to this `event` in your module or bot\n\n```js\nbp.hear('hello')\n```\n\n#### Reaction\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'reaction',\n\ttext: 'Dany Fortin-Simard reacted using wink',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\treaction: 'wink',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Typing\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'typing',\n\ttext: 'Sylvain Perron is typing',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### File\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'file',\n\ttext: 'Justin Watson shared a file',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tfile: [Object],\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### User mentioned\n\nUser mentioned is sent each time a user mentions another user in a message.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'user_mentioned',\n\ttext: 'User has been mentioned',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tmentionedId: 'U41H4NB9N',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Bot mentioned\n\nBot mentioned is sent to incoming middlewares when your bot is mentioned in a message.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'bot_mentioned',\n\ttext: 'Bot has been mentioned',\n\tuser: [Object],\n\tmentionedId: 'U41H4NB9N',\n\tchannel: { id: 'D45FHSDEW' },\n\tts: '1487273756.000116',\n\tdirect: true,\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Other\n\nSlack connector also receives all other events that come from Real Time Messaging API. You can look at the [documentation](https://api.slack.com/rtm) to have more information about some specific event. \n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'slack',\n\ttype: 'other_types',\n\ttext: 'An another type of event occured',\n\traw: [Object]\n}\n```\n\n#### Direct message\n\nAs you can see in all incoming events, we added a particular field `direct` to differentiate message that comes from channel or direct.\n\n```\n{\n\tdirect: false\n}\n```\n\n#### Validation\n\nThis module also comes with some validation to be certain that events are coming from Slack API. For that, each incoming event are validated using your verification token.\n\n### Outgoing\n\nBy using our module, you can send anything you want to your users on Slack. In fact, this module support most important types of messenge that are available on Slack (text, attachments, button, reaction).\n\n#### Creating actions without sending them\n\nNote that all the below actions are available under two format: `send___` and `create____`, the latter effectively only creating the middleware Event without piping (sending) it to the outgoing middleware. This is useful when combining libraries together (for example Botkit):\n\n```js\n  // This message won't be sent\n  const message = bp.slack.createText(event.channel.id, 'What is your name?')\n  // But `message` is a fully formed middleware event object, ready to be sent\n  // example using the botpress-botkit module\n  convo.ask(message, function(response, convo) { /* ... */ })\n```\n\n### Text\n\nIn code, it is simple to send a message text to a specific channel ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage)).\n\n#### `sendText(channel, text, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` channelId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Channel's recipient identifier.

The promise resolves when the message was successfully sent to slack.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'slack', text: 'Hello'}, event => {\n\tconst channelId = event.channel.id\n\tconst text = 'Hello human!'\n\n\tbp.slack.sendText(channelId, text)\n\t.then(() => {\n\t\t//Do something else\n\t})\n})\n\n```\n\n### Attachments\n\nBy using this function, you can send any type of attachment to your users ([slack doc](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting).

botpress-dialog\n\nOfficial Dialog module for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress). Uses [dialog-node](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/dialog-node) behind the scenes.\n\n[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-dialog.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-dialog)\n[![NPM Version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/botpress-dialog.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/botpress-dialog)\n\n## Examples\n\n- [Botpress application with Messenger and Dialog modules](https://github.com/dialoganalytics/botpress-example)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ botpress install dialog\n```\n\n## Get Started\n\nConfigure the module with your Dialog API token which is available in your [personal account](http://app.dialoganalytics.com/users/edit), and a bot ID.\n\n<img alt='Configuration' src='/assets/configuration-screenshot.png' width='500px;' />\n\nConfiguration can also be done programmatically by providing the settings in the file `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-dialog.json`.\n\n**Note:** Please note this currently only works with [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the module is installed and configured, every incoming and outgoing messages will be tracked by Dialog.\n\n### Advanced\n\nAdvanced instrumentation is exposed via the `bp.dialog` object. The following methods are available:\n\n#### Events\n\nSend events to Dialog to keep track of your custom logic. Optionally pass an Interlocutor's distinct id to tie the event to one of your bot's interlocutors. See [docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/event#create](https://docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/event#create)\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.event('subscribed', 'interlocutorDistinctId', { custom: 'value' })\n```\n\n#### Clicks\n\nRecord clicks by interlocutors inside a conversation using a trackable link. For every links that needs to be tracked, generate a trackable URL by passing the interlocutor's distinct Id (provided by the platform or provider) and the `url` to the `link` method. See [docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/click-tracking](https://docs.dialoganalytics.com/reference/click-tracking/)\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.link('http://example.com', interlocutorDistinctId)\n// https://api.dialoganalytics.com/v1/b/7928374/clicks/?id=123456&url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com\n```\n\n#### Attach\n\nModify the current `track` payload about to be sent to Dialog's API with this helper method.\n\nFor example, you can specify a message name:\n\n```js\nbp.dialog.attach('welcome')\nbp.dialog.attach({ message: { name: 'welcome' }}) // equivalent\n```\n\nThis will modify the `track` payload:\n\n```js\n{\n  message: {\n    name: \"welcome\",\n    ...\n  },\n  conversation: { ... },\n  creator: { ... }\n}\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"pdionne","email":"dionne.phil@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-02-23T19:07:07.587Z","created":"2016-12-21T22:44:20.129Z","1.0.0":"2016-12-21T22:44:20.129Z","1.0.1":"2016-12-21T23:05:42.123Z","1.0.2":"2016-12-21T23:20:46.103Z","1.0.3":"2017-01-04T20:16:48.446Z","1.0.4":"2017-01-06T16:22:58.983Z","1.0.5":"2017-01-09T20:27:16.678Z","1.0.6":"2017-01-10T20:45:43.617Z","1.0.7":"2017-01-17T16:37:52.136Z","1.0.8":"2017-01-18T14:52:37.597Z","1.0.9":"2017-01-19T16:26:35.419Z","1.0.10":"2017-01-19T16:32:09.194Z","1.0.11":"2017-01-20T21:49:10.385Z","1.0.12":"2017-01-21T18:30:25.613Z","1.0.13":"2017-01-31T22:11:16.728Z","1.0.14":"2017-01-31T23:21:15.126Z","1.0.15":"2017-02-22T15:35:21.800Z","1.0.16":"2017-02-23T19:02:36.460Z","1.0.17":"2017-02-23T19:07:07.587Z"},"author":{"name":"Philippe

You don't have to use external connectors interface to follow your conversations.\n\n<img src='/assets/hitl-screenshot.png' height='300px'>\n\n### Filtering by status\n\nYou can filter conversations based on their status (paused/active) by using filtering button in the UI.\n\n### Pausing/resuming conversations\n\nYou can pause or resume any conversations from the UI.\n\n## API\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-hitl/sessions/{$id}/pause`\n\nPause a specific conversation by using his `id`.\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-hitl/sessions/{$id}/unpause`\n\nResume a conversation for a specific user.\n\n## Example\n\nA basic implementation example that shows how easy it is to implement a help request in Messenger.\n\n```js\n  const _ = require('lodash')\n\n  module.exports = function(bp) {\n    bp.middlewares.load()\n\n    bp.hear(/HITL_START/, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendTemplate(event.user.id, {\n        template_type: 'button',\n        text: 'Bot paused, a human will get in touch very soon.',\n        buttons: [{\n          type: 'postback',\n          title: 'Cancel request',\n          payload: 'HITL_STOP'\n        }]\n      })\n\n      bp.notifications.send({\n        message: event.user.first_name + ' wants to talk to a human',\n        level: 'info',\n        url: '/modules/botpress-hitl'\n      })\n      bp.hitl.pause(event.platform, event.user.id)\n    })\n\n    bp.hear(/HITL_STOP/, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Human in the loop disabled. Bot resumed.')\n      bp.hitl.unpause(event.platform, event.user.id)\n    })\n\n    bp.hear({ type: 'message', text: /.+/i }, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'You said: ' + event.text)\n    })\n  }\n```\n\n**Note**: This is the only code you need to add to your bot in your `index.js` file.\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- Add pause bot in the UI\n- Implement other types of message to view them in UI (template, buttons, etc.)\n\n## Contribution\n\nBotpress Team would really like to have some help from the community to work on this important module. By helping us, you will contribute to the core and by the way, you will become one of our **Botpress Leaders**!\n\n## Community\n\nThere's a [Slack community](https://slack.botpress.io) where you are

botpress-rivescript\n\n[RiveScript](https://www.rivescript.com/) is a simple scripting language for chatbots with a friendly, easy to learn syntax.\n\n**botpress-rivescript** implements the RiveScript language as an incoming middleware and adds extra support for executing arbitraty code. Combining the simplicity of RiveScript and the flexibility of Botpress allows people to create very complex and rich dialogs, including sending Cards, Quick Replies, Buttons, Webviews, etc...\n\n**Supported connectors:** [botpress-messenger](https://github.com/botpress/botpress-messenger)\n\n<img src='/assets/screenshot-rivescript.png' height='250px'>\n\n## Get started\n\n```\nbotpress install rivescript\n```\n\nThe rivescript module should now be available in your bot UI, and the APIs exposed.\n\n## Features\n\n### Multi-files\n\nYou can split your dialog into multiple Rive files. By default, two files are provided (`star.rive` and `begin.rive`), as advised by the official [RiveScript documentation](https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial#catch-all-trigger).\n\n### Conversation Simulator\n\nThere's a built-in conversation simulator so that you can test your scripts right from the interface. The simulator also supports `JS Code` execution, including asynchronous invocations.\n\n### Variable Injections\n\n#### User Profiles\n\nIf provided, the content of the `MiddlewareEvent['user']` is injected into the variables.\nFor Facebook, `first_name`, `last_name`, `timezone`, `locale`, `gender`, `avatar_url` are available.\n\n```\n+ what is my name\n- According to your facebook profile, your name is <get first_name> <get last_name>\n```\n\n#### Platform\n\nThe platform is injected in the user variables as the `platform` name.\n\n```\n+ what platform am i using\n- Your talking to me on <get platform>, silly!\n```\n\n### Subroutines\n\n#### <call>wait MS</call>\n\n```\n+ toc toc\n- <call>wait 2000</call>who is there?\n```\n\n### Running JS code in scripts\n\n```\n+ execute\n- JS: console.log(rs, bp, event, send) // all available\n\n+ log\n- JS: bp.logger.info('Hello from RiveScript')\n\n+ quick replies\n- JS: bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Buy?', { quick_replies: ['Yes', 'No'] })\n```\n\nTo execute your own script, you can register it to `bp` then use it directly in rivescript\n\nIn your index.js\n```js\nbp.hello = (bp, send) => {\n  bp.logger.info('Will send from a custom script !')\n  send('This is a reply !', { quick_replies: ['Yes', 'No'] })\n}\n```\n\nIn your rivescript\n```\n+custom\n- JS: bp.hello(bp, send)\n```\n### UTF-8 Support\n\nYou can enable UTF-8 input parsing by either one of these methods:\n\n- Set the `RIVESCRIPT_UTF8=true` environement variable\n- Call `bp.rivescript.setUtf8(true)` in your bot\n\nRead more about RiveScript and its [UTF8 support here](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js#utf-8-support)\n\n## API\n\n### `GET /api/botpress-rivescript/scripts`\n\nList all the scripting files and their content.\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-rivescript/scripts`\n\nCreate or replace a Rive scripting file. This will automatically trigger an Engine reload.\n\n#### Body\n\n```js\n{\n  name: string, // *required*, the name of the Rive scripting file\n  content: string, // *required*, the full content of the script, must be valid RiveScript language\n  overwrite: boolean // defaults to *false*\n}\n```\n\n#### Response\n\nStatus `200`\n\n### `DEL /api/botpress-rivescript/scripts/:name`\n\nDelete a scripting file. This will automatically trigger an Engine reload.\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-rivescript/simulate`\n\nSimulate an incoming message into the RiveScript engine. **Does not** pass through the middlewares, goes directly to the RiveScript engine. Returns a response.\n\n#### Body\n\n```js\n{\n  text: string // *required*, the text to send to the RiveScript engine\n}\n```\n\n#### Response\n\n```\n\"Hello, Human!\"\n```\n\n### `POST /api/botpress-rivescript/reset`\n\nRestart a conversation from scratch, erasing all variables or previous conversational state.\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed!

botpress-api.ai\nThe easiest way to create an API.AI bot with Botpress\n\n## Getting started\n\n```\nbotpress install api.ai\n```\n\nThe API.AI module should now be available in your bot UI\n\n## Features\n\nThis module has two modes: **Default** (amend incoming events) and **Fulfillment** (respond automatically).\n\n### Default Mode\n\nThis mode will inject understanding metadata inside incoming messages through the API.AI middleware.\n\nEvents will have an `nlp` property populated with the extracted metadata from API.AI.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you want to handle the conversation flow yourself and only want to extract entities from incoming text. This is great for programmers.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({'nlp.action': 'smalltalk.person'}, (event, next) => {\n  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'My name is James')\n})\n```\n\n### Fulfillment Mode\n\nThis mode will check if there's an available response in the `fulfillment` property of the API.AI response and respond automatically. No code required.\n\n**Note:** Works only with single-response text. We do not support Cards and quick responses.\n\n**Tip:** This is great for non-programmers or if all your conversation logic is hosted on API.AI.\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nThere's a [Slack community](https://slack.botpress.io) where you are welcome to join us, ask any question and even help others.\n\nGet an invite and join us now! 👉[https://slack.botpress.io](https://slack.botpress.io)\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-api.ai is licensed under

Validate and Connect!\n\nTo see in details how to configure completly this module, videos are available on our Youtube Channel \\(soon\\).\n\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Profile](#profile)\n* [Text messages](#text-messages)\n* [Postbacks](#postbacks)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Referrals](#referrals)\n* [Quick replies](#quick-replies)\n* [Optins](#optins)\n* [Delivery](#delivery)\n* [Read](#read)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text messages](#text-messages-1)\n* [Attachments](#attachments-1)\n* [Templates](#templates)\n* [Quick replies](#quick-replies-1)\n* [Automatic typing indicator](#automatic-typing-indicator)\n* [Postbacks](#postbacks-1)\n* [Referrals](#referrals-1)\n* [Display Get Started](#display-get-started)\n* [Greeting message](#greeting-message)\n* [Persistent menu](#persistent-menu)\n* [Automatically mark as read](#automatically-mark-as-read)\n* [Trusted domains](#trusted-domains)\n* [Automatic profile lookup](#automatic-profile-lookup)\n* [Save users in DB](#save-users-in-database)\n* [Webhook security check](#webhook-security-check)\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming event easily with Botpress by using `bp` built-in `hear` function. You only need to listen to specific Messenger event to be able to react to user's actions.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({ platform: 'facebook', type: 'postback', text: 'GET_STARTED' }, (event, next) => {\n      bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Welcome on Botpress!!!')\n   }\n})\n```\n\nIn fact, this module preprocesses almost all types of message (message, attachment, postback, quick_reply, delivery, read, optin, referrals...) and send them to incoming middlewares. When you build a bot or a module, you can access to all information about incoming messages that have been send to  middlewares.\n\n```js\nbp.middlewares.sendIncoming({\n   platform: 'facebook',\n   type: 'message',\n   user: profile,\n   text: e.message.text,\n   raw: e\n})\n```\n\n#### Profile\n\nYou can acces to all user's profile information by using this module. A cache have been implemented to fetch all information about users and this information is sent to middlewares.\n\n```js\n{\n  id: profile.id,\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  gender: profile.gender,\n  timezone: profile.timezone,\n  locale: profile.locale\n}\n```\n\n**Note**: All new users are automatically saved by this module in Botpress built-in database (`bp.db`).\n\n#### Text messages\n\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Messenger platform with all specific information.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'message',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.text,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can listen easily to this `event` in your module or bot\n\n```js\nbp.hear('hello')\n```\n\n#### Postbacks\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'postback',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.postback.payload,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Attachments\n\nThe original attachments messenger event. May contain multiple attachments. Individual attachments are also emmited individually (see Image, Video, File below)\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'attachments',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.attachments.length,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n##### Image\n\nIndividual Attachment extracted from the Attachments event.\n\nNote that Stickers, Thumbs Up, GIFs and Pictures are considered images too.\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'image', // Same for 'video', 'file' and 'audio'\n  user: profile,\n  text: 'http://www.image.url',\n  raw: { type: 'image', payload: { url: '...' }}\n}\n```\n\n##### Audio\n##### Video\n##### File\n\nSame signature as `Image` above.\n\n#### Referrals\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'referral',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.referral.ref,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Quick Replies\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'quick_reply',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.message.quick_reply.payload,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Optins\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'optin',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.optin.ref,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Delivery\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'delivery',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.delivery.watermark,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n#### Read\n\n```js\n{\n  platform: 'facebook',\n  type: 'read',\n  user: profile,\n  text: e.read.watermark,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n### Outgoing\n\nBy using our module, you can send anything you want to your users on Messenger. In fact, this module support all types of messenge that are available on Facebook (text, images, videos, audios, webviews...).\n\n#### Creating actions without sending them\n\nNote that all the below actions are available under two format: `send___` and `create____`, the latter effectively only creating the middleware Event without sending it to the outgoing middleware. This is useful when combining libraries together (for example Botkit):\n\n```js\n  // This message won't be sent\n  const message = bp.messenger.createText(event.user.id, 'What is your name?')\n  // But `message` is a fully formed middleware event object, ready to be sent\n  // example using the botpress-botkit module\n  convo.ask(message, function(response, convo) { /* ... */ })\n```\n\n### Text messages\n\nIn code, it is simple to send a message text to a specific users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/text-message)).\n\n#### `sendText(userId, text, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier. Usually, this `recipient_id` is available from input message.\n\n2. ` text ` (_String_): Text message that will be send to user.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain:\n- `quick_replies` which is an array of quick replies to attach to the message\n- `typing` indicator. true for automatic timing calculation or a number in milliseconds (turns off automatically)\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the text message that needs to be sent to Messenger platform. The promise resolves when the message was successfully sent to facebook, except if you set the `waitDelivery` or `waitRead` options.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst text = \"Select between these two options?\"\nconst options = {\n  quick_replies: [\n    {\n      content_type: \"text\",\n      title: \"Option 1\",\n      payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION_1\"\n    },\n    {\n      content_type:\"text\",\n      title:\"Option 2\",\n      payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION_2\"\n    }\n  ],\n  typing: true,\n  waitRead: true\n}\n\nbp.messenger.sendText(userId, text, options)\n.then(() => {\n  // the message was read because of `waitRead` option  \n})\n```\n\n### Attachments\n\nBy using this function, you can send any type of attachment to your users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/contenttypes)).\n\n#### `sendAttachment(userId, type, url, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier\n\n2. ` type ` (_String_): Specific type of  attachment can be `'audio'`, `'file'`, `'image'` or `'video'`\n\n3. ` url ` (_String_): Correspond to specific url of the attachment that need to be sent.\n\n4. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contain:\n- `quick_replies`\n- `typing`\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the attachment that needs to be sent to Messenger platform.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst type = 'image'\nconst url = 'https://github.com/botpress/botpress/blob/master/images/botpress-dark.png?raw=true'\n\nbp.messenger.sendAttachment(userId, type, url)\n```\n\n### Templates\n\nBy using this module, it's easy to send any type of supported template to your users ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/templates)).\n\n#### `sendTemplate(userId, payload, [options])` -> Promise\n\n##### Arguments\n\n1. ` userId ` (_String_): Correspond to unique Messenger's recipient identifier\n\n2. ` payload ` (_Object_): Specific `payload` object for your selected template. Actually, many types of template (button, generic, list, receipt...) are supported by Messenger.\n\n3. ` options ` (_Object_): An object that may contains:\n- `typing`\n- `waitDelivery` the returning Promise will resolve only when the message is delivered to the user\n- `waitRead` the returning Promise will resolve only when the user reads the message\n\n##### Returns\n\n(_Promise_): Send to outgoing middlewares a formatted `Object` than contains all information (platform, type, text, raw) about the template that needs to be sent.\n\n##### Example\n\n```js\nconst userId = 'USER_ID'\nconst payload = {\n    template_type: \"button\",\n    text: \"Have you seen our awesome website?\",\n    buttons: [\n        {\n            type: \"web_url\",\n            url: \"https://www.botpress.io\",\n            title: \"Show Website\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nbp.messenger.sendTemplate(userId, payload, { typing: 2000 })\n```\n\n#### Quick replies\nBy using `options` argument, you can easily add quick replies to text messages or attachments.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n    quick_replies: [\n        {\n            content_type :\"text\",\n            title: \"Option\",\n            payload: \"DEVELOPER_DEFINED_PAYLOAD_FOR_OPTION\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Automatic typing indicator\n\nAs quick replies, you can add an automatic typing indicator to your messages by adding `typing` to `options` argument.\n\n```js\nconst options = { typing: true }\n```\n\n\n#### Postbacks\n\nThis module support postbacks. Postbacks occur when a Postback button, Get Started button, Persistent menu or Structured Message is tapped ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/postback)).\n\n#### Referrals\n\nThis module also support referrals. In fact, the value of the `ref` parameter is passed by the server via webhook and we are able to access these referrals in parameters of input messages ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/referral)).\n\n#### Display Get Started\n\nTo active get started button on Messenger, users can modify display setting directly in user interface ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/get-started-button)).\n\n<img alt='Get started button' src='/assets/display-get-started.png' width='600px' />\n\n\n#### Greeting message\n\nDirectly in module view, users are able to modify greeting message ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/greeting-text)).\n\n\n<img alt='Greeting message' src='/assets/greeting-message.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Persistent menu\n\nUsers can directly modify persistent menu in module user interface. By using UI, it's possible to add, modify and remove items \\([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/persistent-menu)\\).\n\n<img alt='Persistent menu' src='/assets/persistent-menu.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Automatically mark as read\n\nDirectly in UI, users can setup if they want to automatically mark all messages as read ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference/message-read)).\n\n<img alt='Mark as read' src='/assets/automatically-mark-as-read.png' width='600px' />\n\n#### Trusted domains\n\nBy using UI, users can configure \\(add, modify and remove\\) trusted domains ([facebook doc](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/thread-settings/domain-whitelisting)).\n\n<img alt='Trusted domains' src='/assets/trusted-domains.png' width='600px'/>\n\n#### Automatic profile lookup\n\nProfiles are automatically lookedup using Facebook Graph API. The profile of the user can be found in the incoming middleware events: `event.user`\n\nThe following properties are available: first_name, last_name, locale, gender, timezone.\n \n#### Save users in Database\n\nUsers are automatically persisted in the built-in botpress database using the built-in `bp.db.saveUser` function.\n\n#### Webhook security check\n\nbotpress-messenger verifies that requests really come from Facebook's servers by validating requests hash.\n\n## Example\n\n* Botpress examples \\(soon\\).\n* Youtube Channel \\(soon\\).\n\n### Community\n\nThere's a [Slack

botpress-discord\n\n## Installation\n\nInstalling modules on Botpress is simple. By using the CLI, you only need to type this command in your terminal to add the discord module to your bot.\n```\nbotpress install discord\n```\n\nIt's also possible to install it though the Botpress UI in the modules section. (probably)\n\n## Get started\n\n##### 1. Create a [**new Discord app**](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)\n<img alt=\"Create app\" src=\"/assets/create-app-discord.png\" width=\"500px\" />\n\n#### 2. Add a bot user to your app\nJust press the \"Add bot user button\"\n\n#### 3. Copy the newly generated token\n\n#### 4. Insert the token into the config\nThe config is located at _modules_config/botpress-discord.json_. Insert the token as string at the key \"botToken\".\n\n#### 5. ????\n#### 6. Profit!\n\n## Features\n\n### Incoming\n\n* [Text messages](#text-messages)\n\n### Outgoing\n\n* [Text messages](#text-messages-1)\n* [Attachments](#attachments)\n* [Images](#images)\n\n## Reference\n\n### Incoming\n\nYou can listen to incoming events easily with Botpress by using the built-in \"hear\" function.\n```js\nbp.hear({platform: \"discord\", type: \"text\", text: /^hello/i}, event => {\n  bp.discord.sendText(event.channel.id, \"Welcome!\")\n})\n```\n\n#### Text messages\nAn `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Discord.\n```js\n{\n  platform: \"discord\",\n  type: \"text\",\n  user: e.author,\n  text: e.content,\n  channel: e.channel,\n  raw: e\n}\n```\n\n### Outgoing\n\n#### Text messages\n```js\nbp.discord.sendMessage(channelId, text)\n```\n\n#### Attachments\n```js\nbp.discord.sendAttachment(channelId, description, uri)\n```\n\n#### Images\n```js\nbp.discord.sendImage(channelId, uri)\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"pako_","email":"paul@niobium.me"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-03-15T19:05:54.065Z","created":"2017-02-18T21:12:44.722Z","1.0.0":"2017-02-18T21:12:44.722Z","1.0.1":"2017-02-19T12:49:02.938Z","1.0.2":"2017-02-19T13:14:11.568Z","1.0.3":"2017-02-19T13:17:48.562Z","1.0.4":"2017-02-21T20:48:06.058Z","2.0.0":"2017-03-02T16:26:56.014Z","2.0.1":"2017-03-13T10:22:20.538Z","2.0.2":"2017-03-14T20:36:09.593Z","2.0.3":"2017-03-14T20:42:26.981Z","2.0.4":"2017-03-14T20:55:22.618Z","2.0.5":"2017-03-15T16:43:22.418Z","2.0.6":"2017-03-15T18:46:05.330Z","2.0.7":"2017-03-15T18:51:13.445Z","2.0.8":"2017-03-15T18:55:16.424Z","2.0.9":"2017-03-15T19:05:54.065Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/TheFreakLord/botpress-discord#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/TheFreakLord/botpress-discord.git"},"author":{"name":"Paul

botpress-monetize (powered by RadBots)\n\nMonetization plugin for [Botpress](http://github.com/botpress/botpress) (powered by [RadBots](https://radbots.com))\n\n## Installation\nMonetize module can be installed using any of the following way:\n### Installing using the CLI\nFrom CLI, `cd` to the botpress root directory and run:\n``` \nbotpress install monetize\n```\n### Installing using Botpress UI\n\nFrom the botpress UI, you will see a module named **Monetize**. Click the **install** button.\n\n## Get started\n\nTo get started, you need to fill the **Configure RadBots** section directly in the module interface **RadBots**.\n\n<img src=\"/assets/configure_section.png\" alt=\"Configure RadBots\" width=\"500px\" />\n\nSettings can also be set pragmatically by providing the settings in the `${modules_config_dir}/botpress-monetize.json`\n\n### Getting configuration information\n1. Go to https://radbots.com\n2. Create an account / Login if you already have an account\n3. Create an agent (Agent type is **web**)\n4. You will get an **agent key**\n5. Use the **agent key** in the configuration section of RadBots\n6. Navigate to **settings** at the RadBots website\n7. In the **general** tab, we will get the **account key**\n8. Use the **account key** in the configuration section of RadBots\n\n## Usage\n\n### Getting advertise from RadBots\n\nHere we are listening for `get-advertise` key. when we hear that, we call the RadBots api to get an advertise.\n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    // ad is instance of Advertise class \n\t});\n});\n```\n### Getting customized advertise from RadBots\n\nHere we are listening for `get-custom-advertise` key. when we hear that, we call the RadBots api to get an advertise and pass some options to customize the advertise or adding meta values to the advertise you are receiving.\n```\nbp.hear('get-custom-advertise', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise({\n\t    mediaType: <mediaType>,\n\t    context: <context>,\n\t    personaId: <personaId>,\n\t    tags: <tags>,\n\t    intent: <intent>\n\t}).then(ad => {\n\t    // ad is instance of Advertise class \n\t});\n});\n```\n[Learn more about this options at RadBots](https://radbots.com/documentation/developers)\n### Sending advertise\n#### As Button Template for messenger\n\n[What is button template?](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/button-template)\n\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-button-template` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getMessengerButtonTemplate()` method and send it using `sendTemplate()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-button-template', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendTemplate(event.user.id, ad.getMessengerButtonTemplate());\n\t});\n});\n```\n\n\n#### As Generic Template for messenger\n\n[What is generic template?](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-api-reference/generic-template)\n\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-generic-template` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getMessengerGenericTemplate()` method and send it using `sendTemplate()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-generic-template', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendTemplate(event.user.id, ad.getMessengerGenericTemplate());\n\t});\n});\n```\n\n#### As text message to messenger\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-text` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getRawData()` method which will return raw values that we received from RadBots and send it using `sendText()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-text', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, ad.getRawData().cta_long); // This is the \"Call-to-action\" typically a more in-depth \"about\" regarding the ad.\n\t    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, ad.getRawData().cta_mini); // This is the \"Call-to-action\" mini, which is a short title for the CTA\n\t    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, ad.getRawData().url); // This is the location where you'll send people when they click the ad.\n\t});\n});\n```\n**Note:** Make sure to whitelist `www.radbots.com` from the messenger module, otherwise url won't be sent to messenger\n\n#### As image to messenger\nAfter installing the messenger module of Botpress, here we are listening for `get-advertise-as-image` key. After getting the advertise, we call `getRawData()` method which will return raw values that we received from RadBots and send it using `sendAttachment()` method of the messenger module.  \n```\nbp.hear('get-advertise-as-image', event => {\n\tbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n\t    bp.messenger.sendAttachment(event.user.id, 'image', ad.getRawData().media.url.large);  // large image\n\t    bp.messenger.sendAttachment(event.user.id, 'image', ad.getRawData().media.url.medium); // medium image\n\t    bp.messenger.sendAttachment(event.user.id, 'image', ad.getRawData().media.url.thumb);  // thumbnail image\n\t});\n});\n```\n**Note:** Make sure to whitelist `www.radbots.com` from the messenger module, otherwise image url won't be sent to messenger\n\n## API\n\n### bp.monetize.getAdvertise()\nreturns an `promise` which receives an `Advertise` object on success response.\n```\nbp.monetize.getAdvertise().then(ad => {\n    // ad is instance of Advertise class\n});\n```\n### Params of bp.monetize.getAdvertise()\nAn optional object can be passed to `getAdvertise()` method to customize the advertise or adding meta values to the advertise. The object can have these keys:\n```\n{\n    mediaType: <mediaType>,\n    context: <context>,\n    personaId: <personaId>,\n    tags: <tags>,\n    intent: <intent>\n}\n```\n[Learn more about this options at RadBots](https://radbots.com/documentation/developers)\n### Advertise Object\n#### ad.getMessengerButtonTemplate()\nreturns a button template that can be used for sending button template to messenger.

Botkit + Botpress = ❤️\n\n## I don't understand, why a Botkit module?\n\nAppart from being awesome, [Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) is the most popular open-source bot development tool. If you've been playing with Botpress a bit, you probably noticed that it lacks a conversation management system (which Botkit offers). Our philosophy at Botpress is to have a small & powerful core and leverage the best tools available by integrating them as Modules.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### 1. Get acquinted with [Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) first\n### 2. Install this module in your bot: `bp i botkit`\n### 3. In your bot's `index.js` file, require Botkit\n\n```js\nvar BotpressBot = require('botpress-botkit').BotpressBot\n```\n\n### 4. Spawn an instance of BotpressBot\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(bp) {\n  var controller = BotpressBot(bp, { /* optional configuration */ })\n  var bot = controller.spawn()\n  controller.startTicking()\n\n  // Use botkit normally\n}\n```\n\n## How does it work?\n\nBoth Botkit and Botpress relies on the concept of middlewares and so it's pretty easy to make them both work together. For this module to work, you must already have a botpress connector installed (for example `botpress-messenger`). The way it works is that Botkit will register an incoming middleware (which should be near the end as it swallows events) and process the messages as they enter the middleware.\n\n```\n[messenger] ---> [botpress-messenger webhook] ---> [dispatch incoming middleware] \n---> [analytics, etc..] ---> [botkit]\n```\n\n## What if I want to use Botkit's built-in connectors?\n\nThen you should use Botkit directly, not this module. If you still want to leverage Botpress, know that it is 100% feasible. It's just the other way around. We haven't tested it yet but we plan on prototyping something later.\n\n## How-tos\n\n### How do I send a non-textual question (`bot.ask`)?\n\nIf you are using an official botpress connector, we usually expose action creators that you can use:\n\n```js\n// instead of doing this\nbp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'My message', { typing: true })\n// do this (notice CREATE*Text instead of sendText)\nconst message = bp.messenger.createText(event.user.id, 'My message', { typing: true })\nconvo.ask(message, /* ... */)\n```\n\n### How do I capture non-textual answers?\n\nThere's an extra configuration that we added to Botkit: `receive_as_text`. This allows you to treat these events as if they were regular messages. `receive_as_text` defaults to `['quick_reply']`\n\nEvents that are captured this way will be prepended by the event type, followed by `::`, followed by their textual value. For example, a quick_reply event would look like: `quick_reply::BOOST_GYM_VIDEO`\n\n### Full example\n\nThis example needs the `botpress-botkit` and `botpress-messenger` modules installed\n\n```js\nconst BotpressBot = require('botpress-botkit').BotpressBot\n\nmodule.exports = function(bp) {\n\n  var controller = BotpressBot(bp, {})\n  var bot = controller.spawn()\n  controller.startTicking()\n\n  controller.hears(['what is my name', 'who am i'], 'message_received', function(bot, message) {\n\n    controller.storage.users.get(message.user, function(err, user) {\n      if (user && user.name) {\n        bot.reply(message, 'Your name is ' + user.name);\n      } else {\n        bot.startConversation(message, function(err, convo) {\n          if (!err) {\n            convo.say('I do not know your name yet!');\n            convo.ask('What should I call you?', function(response, convo) {\n\n              const confirm = bp.messenger.createText(convo.context.user, 'You want me to call you: ' + response.text + '?', {\n                quick_replies: [{\n                    payload: 'BP_YES',\n                    title: 'Yes',\n                    content_type: 'text'\n                  },\n                  {\n                    payload: 'BP_NO',\n                    title: 'No',\n                    content_type: 'text'\n                  }\n                ],\n                typing: true\n              })\n\n              convo.ask(confirm, [{\n                pattern: 'yes',\n                callback: function(response, convo) {\n                  // since no further messages are queued after this,\n                  // the conversation will end naturally with status == 'completed'\n                  convo.next();\n                }\n              }, {\n                pattern: 'no|quick_reply::BP_NO',\n                callback: function(response, convo) {\n                  // stop the conversation. this will cause it to end with status == 'stopped'\n                  convo.stop();\n                }\n              }, {\n                default: true,\n                callback: function(response, convo) {\n                  convo.repeat();\n                  convo.next();\n                }\n              }]);\n\n              convo.next();\n\n            }, {\n              'key': 'nickname'\n            });\n\n\n\n            convo.on('end', function(convo) {\n              if (convo.status == 'completed') {\n                bot.reply(message, 'OK!

[Wordhop](https://www.Wordhop.io) - SDK For Human + AI Conversational Experiences\n\nBots enable businesses to respond to customers immediately but they often fail to understand user intent.  According to Facebook, bots fail 70% of the time. Wordhop helps solve this problem with a toolkit to easily keep humans in the loop when AI fails your customers.    The solution includes an SDK for bot developers to connect their bots to Slack, and a Slack app to get alerts, then pause and take over a bot.\n\n![Solution](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7429980/22609969/491afe58-ea31-11e6-8928-27e1a1f1d6bd.png)\n\n\n\nYou can integrate Wordhop in minutes and it begins working immediately. \n\n### What you can do with Wordhop:\nYou can view a full list of features at (https://www.wordhop.io).  It's core purpose can be explained with this single GIF  \n\n![Takeover](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7429980/22609935/22e39740-ea31-11e6-8286-e5a3ae545565.gif)\n\n\n### What you need to get started:\n* [A Slack Account](http://www.slack.com)\n* [Wordhop for Slack](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=users:read,users:read.email,commands,chat:write:bot,chat:write:user,channels:read,channels:history,channels:write,bot&client_id=23850726983.39760486257)\n* [Botpress with Messenger and/or Slack module installed](https://botpress.io/)\n\n##### Operational Dependencies:\n1.  You'll need an API key from Wordhop and for each Chatbot a Bot Token.  You can get both of those (free) when you add Wordhop to Slack and through a conversation with Wordhop. \n2.  A Messenger and/or Slack module set up in Botpress. \n\n\n### Installation\nInstalling modules on Botpress is simple. By using CLI, users only need to type this command in their terminal to add Wordhop module to their bot.\n```bash\n$ botpress install wordhop\n```\nIt's also possible to install it through the Botpress UI in the modules section.\n\n\n### Usage\nWordhop will immediately start alerting you when your bot has no response, and when your users say something with a negative sentiment. You can also set up custom alerts, such as when a user requests assistance.\n\n##### Dial 0 to Speak With a Live Human Being:\n\nWordhop can trigger alerts to suggest when a human should take over for your Chatbot. To enable this, create an intent such as when a customer explicitly requests live assistance, and then include the following lines of code where your bot listens for this intent:\n\n```javascript\n// match an intent to talk to a real human\nbp.hear({ type: 'message', text: 'human' }, (event, next) => {\n  // let the user know that they are being routed to a human\n  var responseText = 'Hang tight. A human is on the way.'\n  if (event.platform == \"facebook\") {\n    bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, responseText)\n  } else if (event.platform == \"slack\") {\n    bp.slack.sendText(event.channel.id, responseText)\n  }\n  // send a Wordhop alert to your slack channel\n  // that the user could use assistance\n  bp.events.emit('assistanceRequested', {platform: event.platform, raw: event.raw})\n})\n```\n\n\nGo back to Slack and wait for alerts. That's it! \n[Be sure to check out our examples.](./examples/)\n\n\n### Looking for something we don't yet support?  \n* [Join our mailing list and we'll notifiy

botpress-webhook\n\nProvides an interface and APIs to manage webhooks to your bot.\n\n## Quick start\n\nFrom the module page you can create and delete platforms. A platform is an http endpoint where you can post to.\n\nFor example you can create a new \"test\" platform.\n\nThe endpoint will be:\n\n> `https://<hostname>:<port>/api/botpress-webhook/webhook/test`\n\nYou can now post to it:\n\n```\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -d '{\"payload\":\"value\"}' https://<hostname>:<port>/api/botpress-webhook/webhook/test?text=Cheers&type=curl\n```\n\nAnd an incoming message is sent to be heard:\n\n```js\n{  \n   platform:'test',\n   type:'curl',\n   text:'Cheers',\n   raw:{  \n      payload:'value'\n   }\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-webhook is licensed under

botpress-wit\n\nThe easiest way to create a Wit.ai bot with Botpress\n\n## Getting started\n\n```\nbotpress install wit\n```\n\nThe Wit.ai module should now be available in your bot UI\n\n## Features\n\nThis module has two modes: **Understanding** (message API) and **Stories** (converse API).\n\n### Understanding\n\nThis mode will inject understanding metadata inside incoming messages through the Wit.ai middleware.\n\nEvents will have a `wit` property populated with the extracted `entities` and the `context`.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you want to handle the conversation flow yourself and only want to extract entities from incoming text. This is great for programmers.\n\n```js\nbp.hear({'wit.entities.intent[0].value': 'weather'}, (event, next) => {\n  console.log('>> Weather')\n  bp.messenger.sendText(event.user.id, 'Weather intent')\n})\n```\n\n### Stories\n\nThis mode will run your Wit.ai stories automatically given that you defined the **Actions** in botpress.\n\nFor more information about Actions and how they are run, make sure to read [node-wit](https://github.com/wit-ai/node-wit)'s documentation.\n\n**Tip:** Use this mode if you created a conversation flow on Wit.ai's User Interface and want it to run automatically in your bot. This is great for non-programmers.\n\n#### Example\n\n```js\n// Implement your Actions like this\nbp.wit.actions['getWeather'] = request => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    bp.logger.info('Get Weather called', request)\n    // Do something here\n    resolve(request.context)\n  })\n}\n\n// You need to call this method once you are done implementing the Actions\nbp.wit.reinitializeClient()\n```\n\n\n## Community\n\nPull requests are welcomed! We believe that it takes all of us to create something big and impactful.\n\nThere's a [Slack community](https://slack.botpress.io) where you are welcome to join us, ask any question and even help others.\n\nGet an invite and join us now! 👉[https://slack.botpress.io](https://slack.botpress.io)\n\n## License\n\nbotpress-wit is licensed under
