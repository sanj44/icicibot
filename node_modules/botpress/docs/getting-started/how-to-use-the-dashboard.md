# How to use the Dashboard

Botpress ships with a beautiful dashboard acessible by default on `localhost:3000`. The dashboard is meant for Bot Administrators, Content Managers, Data Scientists and Marketing People to be able to do their job without having to learn how to code. This comes in extremely useful for bots in production.

By default, you can do a lot of things there:

* Manage Middleware Flow
* Install and uninstall modules
* See botpress logs in real-time
* Configure & utilize modules
* Get real-time notifications from your bot
* and more

Let's learn a little about each functionality.

## Manage Middleware Flow

At homepage, you'll see two widgets: _Incoming Middleware_ and _Outgoing Middleware_.

It's here to show the middleware processing order. You can change it all the time.

## Install and Uninstall modules

You can manage your all modules using the *Modules* menu on sidebar. It provide a list of all available modules, with description, creator and star number on Githhub.

## See botpress logs in real time

You can see logs clicking on the icon at toolbar. It will show recents logs and the option to export archive log.

## Configure & utilize modules

The majority of the modules provide a UI so that users can use them graphically without involving code. Modules automatically appear in the left sidebar after being installed.

## Get real-time notifications

All notifications are acessible in the Botpress topbar menu. You can mark all as read and see recents notifications.

## And more!

You can also change your Botpress license from the UI, see the About dialog, etc..
