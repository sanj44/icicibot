## Switching to the Botpress License

### Cost

The Botpress License is currently free if your bot has less than 150,000 interactions per month. This license is only compatible with Botpress Beta (version >= 0 and < 1). If you are planning to get more than 150,000 interactions per month, please contact us at [enterprise@botpress.io](mailto://enterprise@botpress.io) to get a custom quote.
